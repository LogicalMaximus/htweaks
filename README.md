Htweaks is a core expansion mod for the Halo: Annihilation modpack which is designed to bring the Halo universe to life with advanced enemy behavior and full-scale faction warfare. This mod introduces three fully functional enemy factions—The Covenant, The Flood, and the Insurrectionists—each with unique units, tactics, and objectives.

At the heart of the mod is the AI Commander System, a powerful dynamic AI that controls each faction with strategic intent. These commanders manage their forces in real-time: deploying units, launching offensives, securing territory, responding to threats, and adapting to your actions on the battlefield. The result is a living war simulation where no two encounters are the same.

Each faction brings its own flavor of warfare:

The Covenant use overwhelming force, vehicle superiority, and energy weapons to crush resistance.

The Flood swarm and infect, growing more dangerous the longer they remain unchecked.

The Insurrectionists rely on guerrilla tactics, ambushes, and hit-and-run operations.

This mod is fully compatible with other Halo content mods and is the foundation for dynamic, large-scale warfare in your Halo modpack experience.
